# Stock Analysis Frontend

This is the React-based frontend of the Stock Analysis application. It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs to provide AI-generated analysis of Indian stocks based on historical data.

Users can select a stock and specify the number of days for analysis. The frontend sends the input to the backend, which integrates with the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve stock data and utilizes OpenAI to generate insightful stock analysis.

## Technologies Used

- React v19.0.0
- React DOM v19.0.0
- React Scripts v5.0.1
- Node.js v20.17.0
- NPM v11.0.0
